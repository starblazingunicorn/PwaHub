### Offline support
Designing offline support in a Progressive Web App (PWA) involves creating a user experience that seamlessly handles situations where users have limited or no internet connectivity. Communicate to users when they are offline. Provide a clear visual indicator or message that notifies them about the loss of internet connectivity. 

users should be provided  with a reliable and uninterrupted experience, allowing them to continue using essential features and accessing previously loaded content even when they have limited or no internet connectivity.

### Splash screen
A splash screen in a Progressive Web App (PWA) is a screen that is displayed to users when they launch the app before the app's content is fully loaded. It serves as a visual placeholder or loading indicator to provide feedback to users that the app is initializing and to create a smooth transition from launching the app to displaying its content.

### Add to home screen
By designing a user-friendly and informative "Add to Home Screen" experience, you can encourage more users to install the PWA on their home screen, providing them with easy access to the app and enhancing their engagement and usability.

### Ask users for permissinons
When designing the permission request experience in a Progressive Web App (PWA) UX, it's important to consider user privacy, transparency, and providing clear explanations of why permissions are needed.

Allow users to opt out or change their permissions easily, and ensure that the app functions smoothly even if certain permissions are denied.
