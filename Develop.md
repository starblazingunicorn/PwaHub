## PWA DEVELOPMENT
Before diving into implementation, it's important to grasp the fundamentals of PWAs. PWAs are web applications that can offer a native app-like experience to users, including offline capabilities, push notifications, and access to device features. They are built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
